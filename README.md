### Benchmarking variations on an exponential backoff function


A small framework for benchmarking backoff functions

Two methods:

Simulated many clients exceeding a server-side rate limit to capture the overall performance of a backoff function

simulation stats
- total time for all clients to succeed
- total number of requests required (work)


Monte-carlo simulation to graph and visualize the behavior of a backoff function
